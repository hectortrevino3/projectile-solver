<h2> Overview </h2>
Calculates the optimal launch angle for a projectile to achieve maximum range, accounting for air resistance. It allows you to customize all physical parameters (velocity, height, mass, drag, etc.) and test specific angles to see how real-world physics differs from the simplified 45Â° ideal.

<h2> How It Works </h2>
The solver uses a numerical integration simulation to model the projectile's flight step-by-step. At each interval, it applies the forces of gravity and drag, then a ternary search algorithm iterates through launch angles to find the one that produces the maximum range.

<h2> Usage </h2>
Adjust the parameters in the input fields and click Find Optimal Angle. To test a specific angle, use the dedicated section below.
